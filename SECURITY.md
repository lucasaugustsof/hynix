## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is a top priority for us, and we appreciate your help in keeping Hynix safe for everyone.

If you discover a vulnerability, please **do not open a public issue**. Instead, follow these steps:

1. Send an email to **lucasaugusts@icloud.com** with the subject: `Security Vulnerability Report`.
2. Include the following:
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - (If applicable) Proof-of-concept or related code.
3. We will acknowledge your report within **72 hours** and aim to provide updates every **5 business days** until the issue is resolved.

If the report is confirmed, we will:
- Work on a patch as quickly as possible.
- Credit you in the release notes (unless you prefer anonymity).
- Release an updated version of the affected package(s).

We believe in responsible disclosure and ask that you allow us time to address the issue before going public.
