# Hynix Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

As contributors, maintainers, and leaders of the Hynix community, we are
committed to creating an inclusive, respectful, and harassment-free environment
for everyone. Participation in this community must be free of discrimination,
regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex
characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education,
socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, caste,
color, sexual identity, or orientation.

We pledge to act with respect, empathy, and professionalism, fostering a
collaborative and diverse community.

## Community Standards

Examples of behaviors that contribute to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others
- Respecting different opinions, perspectives, and experiences
- Providing and accepting constructive feedback gracefully
- Taking responsibility for mistakes, apologizing to those affected, and
  learning from the experience
- Focusing on the collective success of the community over individual benefit

Unacceptable behaviors include:

- Using sexualized language, imagery, or unwelcome sexual advances
- Engaging in trolling, insults, derogatory comments, or personal attacks
- Harassment in public or private forms
- Publishing private information (e.g., physical or email addresses) without
  explicit permission
- Any behavior deemed inappropriate in a professional environment

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for upholding and enforcing these standards.
They may take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to unacceptable
behaviors, including:

- Moderating or removing comments, commits, or other contributions that violate
  this Code of Conduct
- Providing explanations for moderation decisions when necessary
